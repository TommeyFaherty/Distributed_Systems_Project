Client is a temporary client to show that the server works
run the client once the server is running, it will prompt you to enter an id (any number) and a password.
It will the respond with the Id, hashed password and salt in that order separated by ":" (e.g "4:[B@6988bbf1:[B@2cfbd5ee")
It will then prompt to enter the hashed password and the salt (2nd value and last value of logger info)
